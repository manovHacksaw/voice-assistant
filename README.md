# Virtual Assistant - Jarvis

This project is a voice-activated virtual assistant named Jarvis. It utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with the user. The assistant is powered by the Ollama model for natural language processing, allowing it to respond intelligently to user queries.

## Project Progress

### Features Implemented
- **Speech Recognition**: The assistant listens for commands using the SpeechRecognition library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responses are spoken back to the user using the pyttsx3 library.
- **Command Handling**: The assistant can perform various tasks including:
  - Playing songs on YouTube
  - Providing the current time and date
  - Opening websites (Google, YouTube, social media, etc.)
  - Searching for information on Wikipedia
  - Responding to general inquiries
- **Ollama Integration**: The assistant uses the Ollama language model for dynamic and context-aware responses.

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate more functionalities like reminders, weather updates, etc.
- Improve the natural language understanding of the assistant.
