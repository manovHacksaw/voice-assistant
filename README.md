# Virtual Assistant - Jarvis

This project is a voice-activated virtual assistant named Jarvis. It utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with the user. The assistant is powered by the Ollama model for natural language processing, allowing it to respond intelligently to user queries.

## Project Progress

### Features Implemented
- **Speech Recognition**: The assistant listens for commands using the SpeechRecognition library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responses are spoken back to the user using the pyttsx3 library.
- **Command Handling**: The assistant can perform various tasks including:
  - Playing songs on YouTube
  - Providing the current time and date
  - Opening websites (Google, YouTube, social media, etc.)
  - Searching for information on Wikipedia
  - Responding to general inquiries
- **Ollama Integration**: The assistant uses the Ollama language model for dynamic and context-aware responses.

### Future Enhancements
- Integrate more functionalities like reminders, weather updates, etc.
- Improve the natural language understanding of the assistant.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- The following Python packages:
  - `speech_recognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `pywhatkit`
  - `wikipedia`
  - `langchain`
  - `ollama`
  - `pyaudio` (ensure you have the appropriate audio drivers installed)
  
### Install Olama on Your System
- Visit the [Ollama Website](https://ollama.com/) and click on Download Button.
 - In Windows Terminal or Powershell: 
    ```bash
          ollama 
          ollama pull mistral


Note: You can use any model available in the Ollama library that suits your system configuration, not just [Mistral](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). Check the [Ollama Documentation](https://ollama.com/library) for more options.

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manovHacksaw/voice-assistant

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
     ```bash
     cd voice-assistance

3. **Install the required packages: You can use pip to install the dependencies. Itâ€™s recommended to create a virtual environment first.**:
   ```bash
   pip install speechRecognition pyttsx3 pywhatkit wikipedia langchain ollama pyaudio langchain-ollama


**Running the ChatBot:**
```bash
python main.py 
```


## Usage
 Upon running, the assistant will greet you and wait for your commands. You can ask it to perform tasks such as playing music, searching the web, or providing information. To exit the assistant, simply say "exit".
